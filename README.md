# vagrant-activemq
Provision a Vagrant Box with ActiveMQ

Assuming  you have already installed VirtualBox and Vagrant,

### Run
- Clone this Repo
- Run `vagrant up`

You can access the ActiveMQ Admin at `http://10.0.10.34:8161/admin`

Feel free to contact me in any case.

I had to increase the memory a bit after provisioning
